The merging process is designed to be as streamlined as possible for the user, only requiring a SummarizedExperiment or SingleCellExperiment object and a specification of which method should be used to integrate in setParams(). 1.1.1 Quick Start Guide Once ensemblemerge is installed, merging batches can be performed by the following: library(ensemblemerge) data #some SingleCellExperiment or SummarizedExperiment object with batches to be integrated params = setParams() #different integration methods can be selected by setting method = c(&quot;Seurat&quot;, &quot;Harmony&quot;, &quot;Liger&quot;, &quot;Scanorama&quot;, &quot;BBKNN&quot;) merged_data = Merge(params, data) A SingleCellExperiment object is returned in merged_data with accompanying dimension reductions if applicable for the integration methods. 1.2 Prerequisites The following R packages are required for installation of ensemblemerge. if (!requireNamespace(&quot;BiocManager&quot;, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(&quot;BiocManager&quot;) BiocManager::install(c(&quot;SingleCellExperiment&quot;, &quot;SummarizedExperiment&quot;, &quot;LoomExperiment&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;Seurat&quot;) devtools::install_github(&#39;theislab/kBET&#39;) devtools::install_github(&#39;satijalab/seurat-wrappers&#39;) devtools::install_github(&quot;cellgeni/sceasy&quot;) If you would like to use the python based integration methods, the following packages must also be installed in your python environment. If you do not have a python environment set, users can also call ensemblemerge::install_python_packages() which will install the python prerequisites into a reticulated python environment. pip3 install scanpy pip3 install bbknn pip3 install scanorama The ensemblemerge package can be installed from CRAN or Github (package is currently in alpha and only available on github to collaborators): install.packages(&quot;ensemblemerge&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;erikjskie/ensemblemerge&quot;) "]]
